#### Thoughts on a continuous deployment strategy

Sometimes a wonderful tool comes along that makes kludgy processes radically better. [Packer](https://packer.io/)  and [ServerSpec](http://serverspec.org/) are great examples. The 1-2 punch of Packer + ServerSpec combined with the automation abilities of [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) can make a significant impact on our automated server image creation. This combination has the possibilities of reducing our time-to-deploy, taking our visibility from ‘translucent’ to ‘transparent’, improved our traceability, and generally made our Ops Engineers much, much happier. Without further a due, here is the proposal.

One of the advantages of having our application run in the cloud is that we can rapidly provision and decommission servers that the application runs on. At [McGraw-Hill Education](https://www.mheducation.com), we love AWS, but could better our practice by creating and replacing EC2 instances all the time. This is a fairly easy process using Server Images ([AMIs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)) but can be a tedious task if you provision them manually. Hence, there is a need to create Server Images rapidly and in a way that the images are tested in order to guarantee a healthy cloud infrastructure.
